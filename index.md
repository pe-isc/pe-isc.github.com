Abstract:

 

A key component for a fast and balanced supercomputer is the
programming environment. The scale and complexity of current and future
high-end systems brings a new set of challenges for application developers. The
technology changes in the supercomputing industry, coupled with the emergence
of new processor and accelerator architectures, force computational scientists
to face new critical system characteristics that will significantly impact the
performance and scalability of applications. With the next generation of
supercomputers, application developers need sophisticated compilers, tools,
libraries, and adaptive runtime systems that can help maximize programmability
with low porting and tuning efforts, while not losing sight of performance
portability across a wide range of processors and architectures. Application
developers need programming environments that can address, as well as hide, the
issues of scale and complexity of high-end HPC systems. This workshop will
focus on programming environments that target supercomputers with emerging
processors from ARM and AMD, and with hybrid systems containing CPUs and GPUs,
and will include a keynote that presents end-user experiences with the
available programming environment on an ARM-based system.   

 

Detailed Description:

 

Intel X86 has been the predominant architecture in high
performance computing in the last few years. More recently the supercomputing
industry has been trending towards building hybrid systems with accelerators
attached to multi-core processors. Now, ARM and AMD had also emerged as viable
processor architectures for supercomputers. However, one of the main concerns
with regards to the adoption of these architectures is the programming environment.
Some of the critical hurdles for the widespread adoption of accelerated
computing in high performance computing are portability and programmability.
The dominant programming models (CUDA and OpenCL) often incur high development
costs and result in non-portable applications. Similarly, the main concern with
regards to these emerging processor architectures is the lack of a mature
programming environment that can help maximize programmability with low porting
and tuning efforts. This workshop will focus on presenting the current state of
the art of programming environments for these emerging processors from ARM and
AMD, and for hybrid systems containing CPUs and GPUs.
