# X86, ARM, GPUs, Oh My! Today’s Programming Environment for the Complex, Many-choice Platforms in HPC

## _Half-Day Workshop to be held at ISC 2018_


A key component for a fast and balanced supercomputer is the
programming environment. The scale and complexity of current and future
high-end systems brings a new set of challenges for application developers. The
technology changes in the supercomputing industry, coupled with the emergence
of new processor and accelerator architectures, force computational scientists
to face new critical system characteristics that will significantly impact the
performance and scalability of applications. With the next generation of
supercomputers, application developers need sophisticated compilers, tools,
libraries, and adaptive runtime systems that can help maximize programmability
with low porting and tuning efforts, while not losing sight of performance
portability across a wide range of processors and architectures. Application
developers need programming environments that can address, as well as hide, the
issues of scale and complexity of high-end HPC systems. This workshop will
focus on programming environments that target supercomputers with emerging
processors from ARM and AMD, and with hybrid systems containing CPUs and GPUs,
and will include a keynote that presents end-user experiences with the
available programming environment on an ARM-based system.
